The project focuses on predicting the monthly "Sales Volume (Units)" for the next three months for Unit Heater Tip, Unit Heater Top, and Unit Heater Ultra using machine learning techniques.
We employed time series analysis alongside various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. Among these models, 
the Gradient Boost Tuned model emerged as the most effective choice, demonstrating a favorable balance of lower errors (RMSE and MAE) and relatively high R-squared values, 
indicating strong performance in prediction accuracy compared to the other models.
